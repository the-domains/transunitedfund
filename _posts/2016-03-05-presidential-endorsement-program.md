# Presidential Endorsement Program 

_"Even if we were to achieve full, legal equality tomorrow, it would not reverse the staggering rate of HIV in our community, end the epidemic of violence, ensure trans immigrants are treated fairly and with dignity, broaden access to educational and employment opportunities or reduce dramatic healthcare disparities."  _

****T**rans United Fund will evaluate candidates based on the following criteria:**

## **Full, Legal Equality                                                                                                        **These office of the President can impact the expansion of full,legal equality through multiple channels,  including but not limited to: executive orders, issues are crucial ****but support for basic, **legal equality is a pre-requisite for support, not a guarantee.** Trans United will evaluate the candidates track record, public statements and formal responses to the **T**rans United Fund candidate questionnaire                                                                                                      

**Living, Meaningful  Equity                                                                                                T****T**ans people, our families and our communities are disproportionately impacted by issues such as HIV/AIDS, Unemployment, Violence, Incarceration, Immigration Detention and Healthcare Disparities.  To earn our endorsement, candidates must demonstrate how they will use the full power of the office they seek to address these challenge                                                                                                                                                                                         **Campaign Practices ** Campaign practices are an excellent indicator of governing practices, that's why TUF asks candidates to outline if they employ trans folks as part of their campaigns (how many, at what level), if they have an explicit non-discrimination policy that includes gender identity and gender expression, if they have a transition policy and inclusive healthcare for their staff etc.                          

**Bully Pulpit     ** When President Obama [uttered the word 'transgender' ][0]in his 2015 State of the Union, he broke with the tradition of Presidential silence around transgender _(and bisexual and lesbian)_ people. We **recognize, appreciate and celebrate **the President's courage and commitment and **w****e expect his successor to do better.  **The President has the power to make our lives and our communities a part of the national conversation; to hire trans staff and make appoint trans people to senior political appointments including their cabinet, the courts and key federal agencies and much, much more. 

Notes

The Global Equality Fund As of February 1, 2016, all foreign entities that enter into contracts with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (which includes the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in the provision of services. HHS is the first of the federal agencies involved in foreign assistance to prohibit discrimination in services for LGBT populations abroad
