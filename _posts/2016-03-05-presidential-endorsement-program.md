# Presidential Endorsement Program 

_"Even if we were to achieve full, legal equality tomorrow, it would not reverse the staggering rate of HIV in our community, end the epidemic of violence, ensure trans immigrants are treated fairly and with dignity, broaden access to educational and employment opportunities or reduce dramatic healthcare disparities."  _

**Full, Legal Equality **

These
office of the President can impact the expansion of full, legal equality
through multiple channels, including but not limited to: executive orders,
issues are crucial but support for basic, 

****

**Living, Meaningful Equity**

****

****

Trans
people, our families and our communities are disproportionately impacted by
issues such as HIV/AIDS, Unemployment, Violence, Incarceration, Immigration
Detention and Healthcare Disparities.  To earn our endorsement, candidates
must demonstrate how they will use the full power of the office they seek to
address these challenge                          

**Campaign Practices               ********Campaign practices are an excellent indicator of
governing practices, that's why TUF asks candidates to outline if they employ
trans folks as part of their campaigns (how many, at what level), if they have
an explicit non-discrimination policy that includes gender identity and gender
expression, if they have a transition policy and inclusive healthcare for their
staff etc.  **

## Bully
Pulpit

When
President Obama in his 2015 State of the Union, he broke with the tradition of Presidential silence around transgender (_and lesbian, and bisexual_) people. We **r****ecognize, appreciate and celebrate** the **President's courage and commitment **and we **expect his successor to do better**. The President has the power to make our lives and our communities a part of the national conversation; to hire trans staff and make appoint trans people to senior political appointments including their cabinet, the courts and key federal agencies
