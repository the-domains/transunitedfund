**[Trans United Fund ][0]**

Trans United Fund is committed to
building the political power of transgender and gender expansive communities
and our allies to advocate for trans/ge communities. 

Trans United accomplishes this mission
though engaging trans/ge communities and our allies in the
political process, building the political leadership and capacity of our
communities and allies and and endorsing candidates with a commitment to
out communities and a pro-trans/gec platform.

Candidates seeking the support of Trans
United Fund must go above and beyond support for basic issues of LGBTQ
equality such as supporting inclusive non-discrimination measures. 
Candidates must demonstrate a strong, proactive, commitment to tackling the
issues like HIV/AIDS, immigration, violence, unemployment,
healthcare disparities and other issues that disproportionately impact our
communities. 

Trans United Fund is a bi-partisan C4
organization. Trans United Fund is organized around the conviction that endorsements
and community support must be earned.
